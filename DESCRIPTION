Description: Provides tools that can be used to calculate, evaluate, plot and use for inference the profiles of *arbitrary* inference functions for *arbitrary* 'glm'-like fitted models with linear predictors. More information on the methods that are implemented can be found in Kosmidis (2008) <https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2008-2.pdf>.
